Here's an example of how to run batch jobs with mdebs.  The principle is
extremely simple.  Just create a batch file containing mdebs commands and run
mdebs with this file on the standard input, like so:

$ mdebs <batchfile

One caveat: you have to make sure the batch file contains error-free mdebs
commands before piping it to mdebs, otherwise mdebs will choke and the results
could be ugly.  Use batch files with care and keep them as short as possible.
